# Links for Class 10 Video Tutorials

1) [One video With TimeStamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSeWYsumDBM)
   It's recommended to watch this series. Even if you're looking for a single practical. The timestamps i.e. chapeters are avaiable in it so that you can just anyone of them to catch your favorite one.

2) [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSeWYsumDBM&list=PLabCvvEwohoqM4yb8oXDZPw1mhvW1KCPK&pp=iAQB)
   In this playlist, I made practical-wise seperate chucks of the above video. So if you prefer watching each practical in a seperate video, you can go for it. You'll also find seperate videos for related helpful stuff that I also included in the above video like Online-IDE video etc.
